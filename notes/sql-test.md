1. In a class of 28 students the mean height of the 12 boys is 1.58 meters and the mean height of all 28 students is 1.52 metres.
   Calculate the mean height of the girls.

   12 x 1.58 = 18.96
   28 x 1.52 = 42.56 
  
   42.56 - 18.96 = 23.6
   23.6 / 16 = 1.475

2. A fair spinner has five equal sections numbered 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
   A fair six-sided dice has five red faces and one green face.
   The spinner is spun.
   If the spinner shows an even number, the dice is thrown.
   Calculate the probability of getting an even number and the colour green.
   
   2 in 5 = 40.00%
   1 in 6 = 16.67%

   16.67% x 40.00% = 6.67%

3. It takes 5 builders 16 days to build a house.
   How long would it take 2 builders of equal ability to build the same house?

   1 builder x 16 days =  20 % of build
   2 builder x 16 days =  40 % of build
   2 builder x 40 days = 100 % of build

4. Complete the following by adding the next two letters in the sequence:

   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18
   A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J  K  L  M  N  O  Q  R  S
   *        *           *        *           *        *

5. A dress is in a sale with the price reduced by 20%.
   By what percentage would you need to increase the reduced cost to return to the original starting value?
